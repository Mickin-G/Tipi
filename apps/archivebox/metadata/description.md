**ArchiveBox is a powerful, self-hosted internet archiving solution to collect, save, and view sites you want to preserve offline.**

**You can feed it URLs one at a time, or schedule regular imports** from browser bookmarks or history, feeds like RSS, bookmark services like Pocket/Pinboard, and more. 

**It saves snapshots of the URLs you feed it in several formats:** HTML, PDF, PNG screenshots, WARC, and more out-of-the-box, with a wide variety of content extracted and preserved automatically (article text, audio/video, git repos, etc.). 

The goal is to sleep soundly knowing the part of the internet you care about will be automatically preserved in durable, easily accessible formats [for decades] after it goes down.
